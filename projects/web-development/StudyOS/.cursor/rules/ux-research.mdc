## Mental Models

### Learning Process Mental Model
Users conceptualize learning as a pipeline:
1. **Input**: New information (lectures, readings, videos)
2. **Processing**: Understanding and organizing (notes, summaries)
3. **Reinforcement**: Practice and repetition (flashcards, exercises)
4. **Application**: Using knowledge (tests, projects, real-world)
5. **Retention**: Long-term memory formation (spaced repetition)

**Design Implication**: StudyOS should visualize this pipeline and show users where they are in the process for each piece of knowledge.

### Task-Learning Relationship Model
Users see two types of tasks:
1. **Learning Tasks**: Acquiring new knowledge
2. **Review Tasks**: Reinforcing existing knowledge

**Design Implication**: The interface should clearly distinguish between these task types and show how they connect to long-term learning goals.

### Progress Mental Model
Users think about progress in multiple dimensions:
1. **Immediate**: What did I accomplish today?
2. **Short-term**: Am I on track this week/month?
3. **Long-term**: Am I achieving my learning goals?
4. **Comparative**: How do I compare to my past performance?

**Design Implication**: Dashboard should provide insights across all these time horizons.
