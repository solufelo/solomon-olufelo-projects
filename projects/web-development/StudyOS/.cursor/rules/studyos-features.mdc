# StudyOS - Multi-Purpose Study Application

StudyOS is a comprehensive study platform built with Wasp that combines multiple learning methodologies and productivity tools.

## Core Features

### 1. Flashcard System (Spaced Repetition)
- **Deck Management**: Create, organize, and manage flashcard decks
- **Smart Review Algorithm**: Implements spaced repetition using the Leitner system
- **PDF to Cards**: AI-powered conversion of PDF documents to flashcards using OpenAI
- **Review Statistics**: Track learning progress and retention rates

**Key Components:**
- `DecksPage.tsx` - Deck management interface
- `DeckCardsPage.tsx` - Card study and review interface
- Models: `Deck`, `Card`, `ReviewLog`

### 2. Task Management System
- **Due Date Tracking**: Tasks with deadlines and completion status
- **Deck Integration**: Link tasks to specific flashcard decks
- **Today's Tasks**: Quick view of tasks due today
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators

**Key Components:**
- Models: `Task` (linked to `User` and optionally `Deck`)

### 3. Pomodoro Timer
- **Study Sessions**: Timed study periods with break intervals
- **Cycle Tracking**: Monitor completed pomodoro cycles
- **Statistics**: Track total study time and productivity metrics
- **Integration**: Connect pomodoro sessions with specific study materials

**Key Components:**
- Models: `PomodoroSession`

### 4. Gamification System
- **Reaction Time Games**: Quick cognitive exercises
- **Score Tracking**: Personal best scores and improvement over time
- **Study Motivation**: Game elements to encourage consistent studying

**Key Components:**
- Models: `GameScore`

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication
- Username/password authentication via Wasp's built-in auth
- User-scoped data (all entities belong to authenticated users)
- Protected routes requiring authentication

### Database Schema
```prisma
User (id, email, password, name, createdAt)
├── Deck (id, name, userId, createdAt)
│   └── Card (id, question, answer, deckId, box, intervalDays, nextDue)
├── Task (id, title, description, dueDate, completed, userId, deckId?)
├── PomodoroSession (id, userId, startTime, endTime, cyclesCompleted)
├── ReviewLog (id, cardId, userId, status, reviewedAt, note?)
└── GameScore (id, userId, score, reactionTime, playedAt)
```

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm
- **Box System**: Cards progress through 5 boxes based on recall difficulty
- **Interval Calculation**: Increasing intervals (1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days)
- **Review Responses**: "Again", "Hard", "Good", "Easy" determine next interval
- **Due Date Management**: Cards become due based on calculated intervals

## Development Guidelines

### Component Structure
- **Feature-based organization**: Group related components in feature directories
- **Shared components**: Common UI elements in `/src/client/components/`
- **Page components**: Main route components in `/src/client/pages/`

### State Management
- **Wasp Operations**: Use queries for data fetching, actions for mutations
- **Local State**: React hooks for component-specific state
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error boundaries and user feedback

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Consistent UI**: Shared color scheme and component patterns

### API Design
- **RESTful Operations**: Clear separation between queries and actions
- **Entity Access**: Proper entity declarations in Wasp operations
- **Authentication**: All operations check for authenticated user context
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP codes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed study metrics and insights
2. **Social Features**: Study groups and shared decks
3. **Mobile App**: React Native companion app
4. **AI Tutor**: Personalized study recommendations
5. **Export/Import**: Anki-compatible deck exchange
6. **Calendar Integration**: Study schedule planning
7. **Collaborative Study**: Real-time study sessions

### Technical Debt
1. **Server Operations**: Replace mock implementations with real database operations
2. **File Upload**: Implement PDF processing pipeline
3. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket integration for live features
4. **Performance**: Optimize queries and implement caching
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for all features

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
wasp start                    # Start dev server
wasp db migrate-dev          # Apply database changes
wasp db studio              # Open database admin UI

# Production
wasp build                  # Build for production
wasp deploy                # Deploy to production

# Maintenance
wasp clean                 # Clean build cache
wasp db seed              # Seed database with test data
```
