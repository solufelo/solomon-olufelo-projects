# Problem-Solving Framework

When encountering complex development challenges, use this systematic approach to evaluate and implement solutions.

## Solution Evaluation Process

### 1. Problem Analysis
- **Define the Problem**: Clearly articulate what needs to be solved
- **Identify Constraints**: Technical, time, and resource limitations
- **Determine Success Criteria**: How will you know the problem is solved?

### 2. Generate Multiple Solutions
Think about 3-5 possible approaches to solve the problem:
- **Quick Fix**: Minimal change, addresses symptoms
- **Comprehensive Solution**: Addresses root cause, may require more work
- **Hybrid Approach**: Balances quick wins with long-term stability
- **Alternative Technologies**: Different tools or frameworks
- **Refactoring Approach**: Restructure existing code

### 3. Solution Evaluation Criteria
For each solution, consider:
- **Implementation Complexity**: How difficult to implement?
- **Maintenance Burden**: Long-term maintenance requirements
- **Performance Impact**: Effect on application performance
- **Scalability**: Will it work as the application grows?
- **Team Familiarity**: Does the team have required expertise?
- **Risk Level**: What could go wrong?
- **Time to Implement**: How long will it take?

### 4. Decision Framework
Present the recommended solution with clear rationale:
- **Chosen Solution**: Which approach do you recommend?
- **Key Benefits**: Why is this the best option?
- **Trade-offs**: What are you sacrificing?
- **Risk Mitigation**: How will you handle potential issues?
- **Implementation Plan**: High-level steps to implement

## Example Application

**Problem**: User authentication is slow and causing timeouts

**Solutions Considered**:
1. **Increase timeout values** - Quick fix, doesn't address root cause
2. **Optimize database queries** - Medium complexity, improves performance
3. **Implement caching layer** - Higher complexity, significant performance gains
4. **Switch to JWT tokens** - High complexity, architectural change

**Recommended Solution**: Optimize database queries + basic caching
- **Rationale**: Balances immediate improvement with manageable complexity
- **Benefits**: 70% performance improvement, maintainable code
- **Trade-offs**: Doesn't provide maximum possible performance gains
- **Risk Mitigation**: Implement monitoring to track performance metrics
