Course Information
This is the 10th year of offering the SAS program. This program enables students required to withdraw
from Laurier to return as quickly as possible. There are likely several factors that have contributed to
your circumstances; SAS is designed to help you identify which of them apply to you so that you can
address the causes for your lack of academic success and complete your degree. You get out of this
program what you put in.

You are required to earn a minimum of 60% (C-) in SASP 001 to be eligible to continue into the second
term of the SAS Program.

Course location: Dr. Alvin Woods Building
Meeting times and days: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:00 am -11:20 am

Course Overview and Approach

SASP 001 is built around a personal exploration of the challenges you may have faced, both inside and
outside the classroom, and which have contributed to your involuntary withdrawal from Laurier. You
will gain awareness of the various life skills that you must develop to achieve academic success. These
skills include managing anxiety, stress, mental health, time, money, and relationships. In addition, the
course provides you with an opportunity to understand your motivations to study, your learning
preferences, and your personality type, which will allow for improved goal setting and course/program
selection. You will also discover your level of accountability and self-regulation.

Through SAS, you will access academic advising for future planning and exposure to
resources available at Laurier. By the end of the SAS program, you should feel connected to a broader
network of students and professionals from the Laurier community, each of whom can provide support

1

as you move through your academic career. The classroom environment will center around active
learning, which means you will be actively engaged in knowledge creation, information gathering and
sharing, and application of lessons and knowledge. Success in this type of environment requires that you
regularly attend class, fully participate, and actively engage in discussions and activities whether live
(synchronous) in class or independently (asynchronous) on MYLS.

Course Goals and Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course students should be able to:

•  Demonstrate a self-awareness of the circumstances that led to the requirement that they

withdraw from the university by identifying and articulating the personal and academic factors
that impacted their success.

•  Create and design actionable solutions by meaningfully engaging in reflective thinking and class

exercises, communicating these solutions in writing and presentations.

•  Demonstrate effective time management skills which includes planning and prioritization by
identifying and scheduling all assessments and submitting them before assigned deadline
Identify and utilize a wide range of resources within/outside the university that can help them
overcome their stated challenges and provide ongoing support to help them navigate their
academic journey

•

•  Compare and evaluate academic program choices to plan realistic academic pathways for their

future.

•  Demonstrate effective collaboration skills through communication, evaluating peer work and

presentations.

Each assessment in our SAS class is designed to achieve one or more of these Learning Outcomes
