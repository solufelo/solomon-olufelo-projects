**\


**Step 1: Identify the obstacles you encountered last semester**\
Upon reflection of the many self-awareness activities we have explored in class, outline the obstacles you believe that have had the most **significant** **impact** on your Academic Standing.  

Please indicate a minimum of **five (5) total obstacles between the two categories.**

|**Academic Obstacles**|**Personal/Other Obstacles**|
| :-: | :-: |
|Prioritizing video editing and creative projects over coursework|Unnecessary relationship that created additional emotional strain|
|Using gaming as an avoidance mechanism instead of completing assignments|Networking anxiety that prevented me from attending classes and engaging with opportunities|
|Complete lack of structured scheduling system to manage time and priorities|Fear of seeking help or appearing vulnerable in academic settings|
|Procrastination patterns that made assignments feel increasingly overwhelming||
|Poor work-life-education balance that put creative pursuits before academic responsibilities||


**Step 2: Generate potential solutions for overcoming the obstacles you listed**\
From Step 1, select the **top three** obstacles that have had the most impact on your academic performance.  For each, create two potential solutions. Make sure you

**justify/provide reasoning** for each solution.

|**Obstacle**|**Solution #1**|**Solution #2**|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Prioritizing video editing and creative projects over coursework|Implement a gamification approach to academic work, treating assignments like "levels to beat" and creating memorable "movie scenes" through academic achievement|Create a structured schedule that allocates specific time blocks for creative work only after academic responsibilities are completed|
|**Why this would help:** This taps into the same satisfaction mechanisms that made creative work appealing, but redirects that energy toward academic success. It transforms the perspective from seeing coursework as boring to seeing it as an engaging challenge.|**Why this would help:** This creates clear boundaries and priorities, ensuring academic work gets done first while still allowing time for creative pursuits. It addresses the root issue of inverted priorities.|
|Using gaming as an avoidance mechanism instead of completing assignments|Apply gaming achievement mindset to academic progress, creating visual progress tracking and reward systems for completed assignments|Build accountability partnerships with classmates or study groups to create external motivation and support|
|**Why this would help:** Since gaming provided immediate feedback and clear objectives, applying these same elements to academics would make coursework more engaging and less likely to be avoided.|**Why this would help:** External accountability would prevent the isolation that enabled avoidance patterns, while building the networking skills I need for my web development career.|
|Complete lack of structured scheduling system|Develop and maintain a detailed weekly schedule using digital planning tools, with specific time blocks for study, assignments, and career skill development|Implement the "time boxing" technique where each task gets a specific allocated time slot, treating schedule adherence like a game with measurable outcomes|
|**Why this would help:** Structure would replace the reactive decision-making that led to poor choices, creating predictable patterns that support academic success.|**Why this would help:** Time boxing creates urgency and focus, while the gamification element makes following the schedule engaging rather than restrictive.|


**Step 3: Commit to workable and achievable solutions**\
To further break down this plan, list the most achievable solutions that you ***know*** you will be willing to try.  Then, explain how these solutions will help you return to your academic success.  Furthermore, identify the sacrifices you may need to make to achieve your goals. 

|**Solution**|**How will this solution assist my return to academic success?**|**What will this solution require of me in terms of time, effort, and resources?**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Implement a gamification approach to academic work|This solution directly addresses my core issue with perspective and motivation. By treating assignments as "levels to beat" and academic progress as achievement unlocks, I tap into the same psychological rewards that made gaming appealing. This transforms coursework from something I avoid to something I actively engage with, creating the momentum needed for consistent academic performance.|**Time:** 2-3 hours weekly to develop and maintain gamification systems, plus ongoing mental effort to reframe challenges. **Effort:** Conscious work to shift perspective in real-time and create visual progress tracking. **Resources:** Digital tools for progress tracking, possibly gamification apps, and commitment to celebrating academic "wins" in meaningful ways.|
|Develop and maintain a detailed weekly schedule using digital planning tools|This creates the systematic structure I completely lacked before, replacing reactive decision-making with intentional planning. A detailed schedule ensures academic work gets priority while still allowing time for web development skill building and creative projects. It provides the accountability framework I need to maintain the integrity of my learning process.|**Time:** 1-2 hours weekly for planning and schedule maintenance, plus daily commitment to following the schedule. **Effort:** Discipline to stick to planned time blocks even when other activities feel more appealing. **Resources:** Digital planning tools, possibly premium scheduling apps, and the sacrifice of spontaneous activities that conflict with academic priorities.|
|Build accountability partnerships with classmates or study groups|This directly addresses my networking anxiety by reframing social academic interactions as career development opportunities. Building relationships with classmates creates external motivation, prevents isolation, and develops the professional networking skills essential for my web development career goals. It transforms my previous avoidance of academic social situations into active engagement.|**Time:** 3-4 hours weekly for study group participation and relationship building activities. **Effort:** Overcoming social anxiety and consistently showing up even when I feel uncomfortable. **Resources:** Commitment to vulnerability in sharing struggles and goals, plus potential costs for group study materials or meeting spaces.|


**Step 4: Be SMART with Goal Setting**

For this step, single out your most important solution, derived from Step 3 above. Then, create a clear goal to set out this solution. Include a possible date of completion.  Use the SMART process to **work out** your goal. You may need to refer back to the in-class work on SMART goals.

Record your full goal **below the table**.

*Sample Goal*: Manage my anxiety regarding school by starting assignments earlier and ensuring that nothing is handed in past the due-date, this semester.

**My SMART Goal:** I will implement a gamification approach to all my academic work by creating visual progress tracking systems, treating each assignment as a "level to beat," and celebrating academic achievements like gaming milestones, completing this system setup within the first two weeks of the semester and maintaining it throughout the term to build the structured, engaging approach to learning that I previously lacked.

SMART Goal Break-down

|**SMART Steps**|**Refining my goal**|
| :- | :- |
|**S** – **Specific**: Make your goal as precise as possible.|I will create a gamification system for academic work that includes: visual progress boards for each course, achievement badges for completed assignments, and celebration rituals for academic milestones. This targets my core issue of finding academic work less engaging than gaming.|
|**M – Measurable:** Be sure that your goal is quantifiable.|I will track: number of assignments completed using gamification approach, time spent on academic work per week (target: 15+ hours), and academic performance improvements (target: maintaining 75%+ average). I'll also measure engagement by recording how often I choose academic work over gaming.|
|**A – Attainable:** Ensure you set a goal you can achieve. Start with writing a statement "by…"|By dedicating 2 hours weekly to system setup and maintenance, and by leveraging my existing understanding of gaming motivation, I can realistically implement this approach. I'll start with simple progress tracking and build complexity over time.|
|**R – Relevant**: Set a goal that has a genuine chance of being accomplished.|This directly addresses my pattern of prioritizing gaming over academics by using the same psychological mechanisms that made gaming appealing. It's relevant to my web development career goals because it builds the systematic approach and project management skills I'll need professionally.|
|**T – Timely:** Establish a timeline for successfully reaching your goal.|System setup completed within first 2 weeks of semester, full implementation by week 4, and consistent use maintained throughout the entire term. Progress review every 2 weeks to ensure effectiveness and make adjustments.|


**Step 5: Predict and prevent barriers** \
To help you stay motivated, you will want to predict and respond to what barriers may come in the way of your SMART Goal.  

Ask yourself the following questions, providing at least **two** answers for each. 

- What barrier(s) may be in my way?  
- What worries do I have about this barrier? 
- What assumptions have I made about this barrier that may not be true? 
- Recognizing these worries and assumptions, how can I act more proactively to prevent this barrier(s)?

|**Barriers**|**Worries**|**Assumptions**|**Prevention**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|Falling back into old gaming avoidance patterns when academic work becomes challenging|I worry that when assignments get difficult or stressful, I'll abandon the gamification system and return to using gaming as an escape mechanism, undoing all my progress|I'm assuming that my new approach won't be strong enough to overcome years of established avoidance patterns, especially during high-stress periods like midterms or major project deadlines|Create a "difficulty spike" protocol where challenging assignments get extra gamification elements (bonus points, special rewards, accountability check-ins). Build in specific strategies for when I feel the urge to game instead of study, like 15-minute gaming breaks as rewards for completing study blocks.|
|Time management challenges with balancing web development skill building alongside coursework|I'm concerned that focusing too much on formal academics will slow my web development learning, or that pursuing programming skills will distract from course requirements, creating conflict between short-term academic success and long-term career goals|I'm assuming I have to choose between academic success and career preparation, rather than finding ways to integrate them effectively|Create integrated learning blocks where I apply web development skills to academic projects when possible. Schedule specific time for both academic work and career skill development, treating both as essential "quests" in my gamification system. Use academic success as motivation for career development time.|


**Step 6: Celebrate successes!**\
It is crucial to evaluate your success to know when you have accomplished your goal.  In addition, you may stay focused and motivated when you provide yourself with a reward. Use short-term goals and rewards along the way to keep you motivated, and then identify something big to celebrate at the end.  

Outline 2 short-term goals you can accomplish in pursuit of your SMART goal and then commit to how you will celebrate reaching each step.   

|**Short-term goals**|**Reward for accomplishing!**|
| :- | :- |
|Successfully implement gamification system for first month (complete visual progress boards, track 4 assignments using the system)|Celebrate with a special gaming session - but only after academic "level" is completed. This reinforces that gaming becomes a reward for academic achievement rather than avoidance.|
|Maintain 15+ hours of weekly academic work using gamification approach for 6 consecutive weeks|Invest in a new piece of tech equipment for my web development setup (mechanical keyboard, monitor upgrade, or programming course), connecting academic success to career development.|
|**How will you know you've accomplished your SMART goal?**|**Reward to celebrate!**|
|I will have successfully used gamification approach for an entire semester, with measurable improvements in academic engagement (choosing academic work over gaming at least 80% of the time when both options are available) and academic performance (maintaining 75%+ average across all courses).|Plan and execute a weekend trip focused on exploring tech opportunities in a major city, visiting tech companies or attending developer meetups. This celebrates academic success while advancing career networking goals and represents the kind of memorable "movie scene" experience I want to create.|


**Step 7: Summary**

My journey to the SAS program began with a required withdrawal that, while initially devastating, ultimately became the most important wake-up call of my academic life. The circumstances that led to my withdrawal weren't just about poor grades or missed assignments – they represented a fundamental misalignment between my daily choices and my long-term aspirations. I was spending entire evenings editing videos and gaming while my coursework sat untouched, not because these activities were more important, but because they provided immediate satisfaction and felt "easier" in the moment. The irony wasn't lost on me later: I was solving complex problems in games while avoiding simpler academic tasks, all because of perspective and mindset. This pattern, combined with an unnecessary relationship that created additional emotional strain and networking anxiety that kept me from engaging with academic opportunities, created a perfect storm of avoidance that ultimately led to my academic failure.

What drew me to the SAS program wasn't just the need to recover academically – it was the recognition that I needed structured support to break cycles that I couldn't break alone. I had developed patterns of avoidance, particularly around seeking help and building professional relationships, that were undermining my success in ways I didn't fully understand. The SAS program offers exactly what I need: a systematic approach to self-awareness, goal setting, and academic success planning. More importantly, it provides the community and accountability that my previous isolation had prevented. Through SAS, I'm learning to transform my networking anxiety into networking opportunity mindset, viewing every class interaction as a chance to build the professional relationships that will support my web development career goals. The program's emphasis on authentic reflection aligns perfectly with my recognition that sustainable success requires genuine understanding of my patterns, motivations, and goals.

My Academic Success Plan centers on implementing a gamification approach to all my academic work, treating assignments as "levels to beat" and academic progress as achievement unlocks. This SMART goal directly addresses my core issue with perspective and motivation by tapping into the same psychological rewards that made gaming so appealing. Instead of seeing coursework as boring or difficult, I'm creating visual progress tracking systems, celebration rituals for academic milestones, and achievement badges for completed assignments. This transforms the experience from something I avoid to something I actively engage with, building the momentum needed for consistent academic performance. The goal is measurable through tracking weekly academic hours (target: 15+), assignment completion rates, and academic performance improvements (target: maintaining 75%+ average).

The potential barriers to my success include falling back into old gaming avoidance patterns during stressful periods and struggling to balance web development skill building with coursework requirements. To prevent these barriers, I'm creating a "difficulty spike" protocol where challenging assignments get extra gamification elements and building integrated learning blocks that apply web development skills to academic projects when possible. My celebration strategy reinforces positive patterns by using gaming as a reward for academic achievement rather than avoidance, and connecting academic success to career development through tech equipment investments and networking opportunities. This plan isn't just about academic recovery – it's about building the disciplined, structured approach that will serve me throughout my web development career and eventual relocation to the United States. Every early submission is practice for meeting client deadlines, every systematic approach to coursework builds project management skills I'll need as a professional developer, and every networking opportunity advances my long-term career goals.
