# SASP-001 Project Documentation Schema

## Overview
This document establishes the comprehensive schema for the Student Academic Success Plan (SASP-001) project, designed to maintain consistency, optimize memory, and enhance productivity through structured documentation and AI-guided assistance.

## Project Structure

### Core Components
1. **Personal Context & Insights** - Your unique voice, experiences, and perspective
2. **Academic Requirements** - Course materials, rubrics, and assignment specifications
3. **AI Training System** - Evolving guidelines for maintaining consistency and tone
4. **Memory Optimization** - Tracking themes, activities, and progress over time
5. **Evolution Framework** - System for continuous improvement and adaptation

## Schema Principles

### 1. Consistency Maintenance
- **Tone Preservation**: All documents maintain your authentic voice
- **Style Guidelines**: Consistent formatting and presentation
- **Reference Integration**: Seamless connection to previous work and experiences

### 2. Memory Optimization
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI understands your history and preferences
- **Progressive Building**: Each document builds on previous work
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Quick access to relevant information

### 3. Productivity Enhancement
- **Template System**: Reusable structures for common tasks
- **Automated Assistance**: AI-guided content generation
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in checks for consistency and completeness

### 4. Evolution Framework
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates based on effectiveness
- **Adaptive Learning**: System learns from your preferences and feedback
- **Future-Proofing**: Scalable structure for ongoing academic work

## Implementation Guidelines

### For AI Assistants
1. **Always consult** the Personal Context before generating content
2. **Reference** previous activities and themes when relevant
3. **Maintain** the established tone and voice profile
4. **Update** memory systems with new information
5. **Evolve** guidelines based on effectiveness and feedback

### For Document Creation
1. **Start** with relevant templates
2. **Incorporate** personal insights and experiences
3. **Connect** to previous work and themes
4. **Ensure** consistency with established voice
5. **Update** tracking systems upon completion

### For Quality Assurance
1. **Voice Check**: Does this sound like you?
2. **Consistency Check**: Does this align with previous work?
3. **Completeness Check**: Are all requirements addressed?
4. **Connection Check**: Are relevant themes and experiences included?
5. **Evolution Check**: What can be improved for next time?

## Success Metrics
