## Chart 1: Obstacle Identification - Sample Content

| Category | Obstacle | Specific Example | Impact on Academics |
|----------|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Academic | Prioritizing video editing and creative projects over coursework | I would spend entire evenings editing videos while my assignments sat untouched, telling myself I'd get to them "later" - but later never came | Led to missed deadlines and ultimately failing multiple courses because I consistently chose immediate creative satisfaction over long-term academic success |
| Academic | Gaming as avoidance mechanism for academic responsibilities | When I had a major assignment due, I would boot up my gaming setup instead, convincing myself that gaming was "easier" than the coursework - even though the games required complex problem-solving that was objectively more difficult | Created a cycle of avoidance that made assignments feel increasingly overwhelming, ultimately contributing to my required withdrawal |
| Personal | Unnecessary relationship that created additional strain | I was in a relationship that demanded emotional energy and time during an already challenging academic period, adding complexity to my already unbalanced life | The relationship complications, combined with academic stress, divided my focus and contributed to poor decision-making in both areas |
| Personal | Networking anxiety preventing class engagement | I would avoid attending classes because I felt anxious about social interactions and networking opportunities, viewing them as uncomfortable situations rather than growth opportunities | Missing classes meant missing crucial information, relationship-building opportunities, and the accountability that comes with regular attendance |
| Academic | Complete lack of structured scheduling system | I had no systematic approach to managing time or priorities - just reacting to whatever felt most appealing or urgent in the moment | Without structure, I consistently made choices that felt good short-term but undermined my long-term academic success |

### Solution: Implementing Gamification Approach to Academic Work

**How this would impact my academic success:**

The gamification mindset represents a complete transformation of how I approach challenges. Instead of seeing coursework as boring or difficult, I now frame every assignment as a "level to beat" and every academic challenge as an opportunity to create a memorable "movie scene" in my life story. This isn't just positive thinking - it's a practical reframing that taps into the same satisfaction mechanisms that made gaming so appealing.

When I realized that I was choosing gaming over coursework because it "felt easier," I had a breakthrough: the coursework was actually objectively easier than the complex problem-solving I was doing in games. The difference wasn't in the actual difficulty - it was entirely in my perspective. Gaming felt rewarding because of immediate feedback, clear objectives, and a sense of progression. By applying these same elements to my academic work, I can transform the experience from something I avoid to something I actively engage with.

This approach would help me create structure where I previously had chaos, turn networking anxiety into networking opportunity mindset, and build the kind of memorable experiences that align with my larger life vision of becoming a web developer and eventually moving to the United States.

**Resources required to achieve this solution:**

*Time*: I need to dedicate focused time to developing and implementing this new framework - probably 2-3 hours per week initially to establish the systems and mindset shifts, then ongoing integration into daily academic work.

*Effort*: This requires conscious effort to reframe my thinking in real-time. When I feel the old avoidance patterns starting, I need to actively apply the gamification lens and ask myself "How can I make this into a level worth beating?" or "What kind of memorable scene am I creating right now?"

*Other resources*: I need to create visual tracking systems (like game achievement boards) for academic progress, establish reward systems that mirror gaming satisfaction, and possibly find accountability partners who understand and support this approach. I also need to research gamification techniques and adapt them specifically to academic contexts.

## Sample SMART Goal - Authentic Voice

**My SMART Goal**: I will complete all assignments at least 2 days before their deadlines this semester, treating each early submission as a "level completed" in my academic game, to build the structured approach I previously lacked and support my web development career preparation.

| SMART Component | My Goal Element | Explanation |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Specific** | Complete assignments 2 days before deadlines | This targets my previous pattern of procrastination and last-minute work that contributed to my required withdrawal |
| **Measurable** | Track completion dates vs. due dates for every assignment | I'll maintain a visual progress board showing "levels completed early" to tap into gaming satisfaction mechanisms |
| **Attainable** | Start assignments when assigned, work consistently rather than cramming | This builds on my gamification approach - treating consistent work as "daily quests" rather than overwhelming projects |
| **Relevant** | Builds structured approach essential for web development career success | The discipline and project management skills directly transfer to professional programming work and freelance client management |
| **Timely** | Every assignment this semester, with progress reviewed weekly | Creates immediate accountability and builds the systematic approach I need for long-term career goals |

### My Academic Journey and the Path to Growth

Looking back on my required withdrawal, I can see now that it wasn't just about poor time management or academic difficulty - it was about a fundamental misalignment between my daily choices and my long-term goals. I was spending hours on video editing and gaming while my coursework suffered, not because these activities were more important, but because they provided immediate satisfaction and felt "easier" in the moment. The irony wasn't lost on me later: I was solving complex problems in games while avoiding simpler academic tasks, all because of perspective and mindset.

The end of an unnecessary relationship during this period initially created additional stress, but it ultimately became one of the most important wake-up calls of my life. Combined with failing classes, these experiences forced me to examine every aspect of how I was living and making decisions. I realized that I wasn't just failing academically - I was failing to align my actions with my deeper aspirations of becoming a web developer and building a meaningful career.

### How These Challenges Led Me to SAS

What drew me to the SAS program wasn't just the need to recover academically - it was the recognition that I needed structured support to break cycles that I couldn't break alone. I had developed patterns of avoidance, particularly around networking and seeking help, that were undermining my success in ways I didn't fully understand. The SAS program offered exactly what I needed: a systematic approach to self-awareness, goal setting, and academic success planning.

I'm genuinely grateful for the opportunity to return stronger. The failures I experienced - both academic and personal - taught me more than any easy success could have. They forced me to develop the self-awareness and systematic thinking that I now recognize as essential for both academic and professional success.

### My Path Forward with Purpose

My SMART goal of completing assignments 2 days early represents more than just better time management - it's about building the disciplined, structured approach that will serve me throughout my web development career. Every early submission is practice for meeting client deadlines, every systematic approach to coursework builds project management skills I'll need as a professional developer.

The gamification mindset I've developed transforms every academic challenge into an opportunity to create something memorable and meaningful. Instead of avoiding networking opportunities due to anxiety, I now see every class interaction as a chance to build the professional relationships that will support my career goals.

### How SAS Will Support My Success

The SAS program provides exactly the structured framework I need to maintain this new approach. Through systematic goal setting, regular check-ins, and community support, SAS helps ensure that I don't slip back into the avoidance patterns that led to my required withdrawal. More importantly, it connects my immediate academic success to my larger vision of web development career success and eventual relocation to the United States.

The program's emphasis on self-awareness and authentic reflection aligns perfectly with my recognition that sustainable success requires genuine understanding of my patterns, motivations, and goals. SAS isn't just helping me recover academically - it's helping me build the foundation for the professional and personal life I want to create.
