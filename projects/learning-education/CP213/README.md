# CP213 Workspace (WSL)

- Windows Eclipse workspace mirrored from `C:\\Users\\solom\\CP213` into `workspace/` (metadata excluded).
- Docs live in `docs/` (syllabus, assignments, labs).
- Use `scripts/export_eclipse_zip.sh` and `scripts/import_eclipse_zip.sh` for Eclipse-compatible zips.
- `.cursor/` contains learning guardrails to enhance understanding without bypassing assessments.
