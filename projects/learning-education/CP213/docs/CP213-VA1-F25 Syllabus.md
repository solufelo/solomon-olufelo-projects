Course Overview and Approach
In this course, you will learn a new programming paradigm, object-oriented programming (OOP), and a new
programming language, Java, to develop software applications. In OOP, every artifact you represent is an
object, and programs are made of interacting objects. Currently, OOP is the most widely used paradigm to
develop  software  applications  and systems.  Similarly,  Java  is  a very  popular  language  and  is  installed on
billions of devices from smartwatches and mobile apps to web applications like Amazon, eBay, etc.
By  the  end  of  the  course,  you  should  be  able  to  design  and  develop  robust,  efficient,  and  maintainable
software  applications  and  systems  using  Java  and  the  OOP  paradigm.  You  should  be  able  to  test  and
document Java programs and develop applications that can efficiently interact with users.

Course Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, the students should be able to:

•  Compile, run, debug, and document Java programs.
•  Read user input from the keyboard, present program output to the screen, and format output.
•  Develop programs in the OOP paradigm using Java features such as classes, objects, interfaces,

inner classes, anonymous classes, arrays, and generic classes.

•  Apply OOP techniques such as Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstract Classes.
•  Handle code exceptions.
•  Develop applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).
•  Use recent Java features such as the lambda expression, Varargs, AutoBoxing, and Unboxing.
•  Use Java Thread and Multi-Threading features and handle application Race conditions.

Lesson Comprehension

At the end of each lesson, some of the main concepts and vocabulary that are covered in the lesson are
listed. To test your knowledge and your understanding of a lesson, you should be able to describe each of
the  listed  concepts  in  a  few  sentences.  You  need to  choose  five  keywords  from  the  list,  describe  each
keyword in a few lines, and upload your answer to MyLS. Don't copy and paste from the lecture, use your
own words. You will get one mark for each correct upload. There is no partial mark, you either get one or
zero.
The best 10 out of 12 lesson comprehension quizzes will be used in your mark. Lesson comprehension
quizzes due dates are listed on MLS. The Calendar feature on MyLS is a good way to keep track of the
upcoming due dates.  A lesson comprehension quiz will be available for 72 hours. You can attempt

Email Etiquette
Please  visit  the  following  link  for  general  instructions  on  emailing  your  instructor  and  lab  instructor:
https://bohr.wlu.ca/cp213/email.php

You can expect a response within two business days. If you do not receive a reply within this timeframe,
please send a follow-up email.

University and Course Policies
Late Submission Policy: Late submissions are not allowed in this course.  Remember that an attempt to
submit in the last  few minutes frequently fails. You can submit your work as many times as you want
before  the  deadline,  so  please  submit  often  and  early.  Please  note  that  only  your  last  submission  is
retained and graded. It is your responsibility to submit the right file in the right folder at the right time.
After submission, you should download your file(s) to ensure that the correct submission was made.

Unacceptable reasons for non-submission, incorrect submission, or late submission include, but are not
limited to the following:

6

•

•

•

•

I experienced technical issues  with my computer  or the Internet  and couldn't submit on time.
Now that the Dropbox is closed, I have attached my assignment here. Note that any assignments
emailed to the instructor or a TA will be disregarded.
I had another assignment due the same day and accidentally submitted that assignment to this
course's Dropbox, or vice versa.
I  accidentally  submitted  the  assignment  questions  instead  of  answers  (e.g.,  I  submitted
A02Given.zip instead of username_a02.zip).
I have proof that I completed it in time. Remember, marks are not awarded for completing an
assignment; they are awarded for successfully submitting the correctly completed work by the
deadline. We do not (and will not) conduct forensic analysis of your work environment. Please do
not send screenshots or other “proof” as evidence, they will not be accepted.

Due Date Extensions: Extensions are only granted if there are some extenuating circumstances. Requests
must be made to your instructor at least 24 hours prior to the original due date of the submission, and
some substantiating documentation is often required. In the absence of substantiating documentation,
the normal late penalty will apply.
Please note that the labs and assignments for all sections of this course are auto-graded and managed
centrally by another professor. Consequently, any extension must be formally approved and coordinated
at the course level. Extensions for last-minute or post-deadline requests are not permitted.

Examples of legitimate reasons for assignment due date extension include:

•

Incapacitating illness. Such request must be accompanied by the Laurier’s Illness Self-Declaration
Form;

•  Death in the family;
•  Accommodations for religious observances must be submitted within two weeks of the start of
term  using  the  Student  Request  for  Accommodation  for  Religious  Observances  form.

Most other reasons, apart from those mentioned above, are unacceptable. These include, but are not
limited to:

•  Vacations
•  Varsity sports practices
•  Work/volunteer schedules
•  Student's forgetfulness or carelessness in planning their schedule
•  Multiple assessments taking place on the same day

As quiz answers will be posted as soon as a quiz closes, no extensions will be given for quiz due dates.
However,  to  accommodate  any  potential  extenuating  circumstances,  the  lowest  quiz  score  will  be
dropped.

Marking  of  Assignments,  Labs,  and  Midterm  Exam:  In  most  cases,  you  will  receive  your  marks  and
feedback within 7 business days of the lab or assignment closing date, or the midterm exam date. If you
receive marks for the labs, assignments,  or the midterm and you do not agree with the assessment for
valid reasons, you have two weeks to bring the issue to the attention of the instructor. After two weeks
from the day you received your mark, the assessment will not be reviewed, and your mark will not be
eligible to be changed.

The assignments and labs for this course will be auto-graded. Auto-grading has its pros and cons. One
disadvantage from the students’ point of view is that there are no partial marks if your code does not
execute. It is your responsibility to ensure that your code runs without errors; otherwise, a score of zero
will be assigned.

Students are advised to consult the Academic Calendars and Governance resources for expanded details
of their rights and regulations.

Missed Final Examinations: Students are strongly urged not to make any commitments (e.g., travel or
vacations)  during  the  examination  period  as  unforeseen  circumstances  can  result  in  exams  being
rescheduled.  Consequently,  students  are  required  to  be  available  for  examinations  during  the
examination periods of all terms in which they register. Refer to the Handbook on Undergraduate Course
Management for more information. If you think you will miss the final exam due to some extenuating
circumstances, you must submit a petition to  defer the final exam to the petitions committee in the
faculty of Science.

Academic  Calendars:  Students  are  encouraged  to  review  the  Academic  Calendar  for  information
regarding all important dates, deadlines, and services available on campus.

Accessibility: Students requiring accessibility accommodation are advised to contact Accessible Learning.
It is the responsibility of the student to review and understand the steps for Registration, as well as to
take an active role in ensuring that information is communicated to the Accessible Learning Consultant
and Instructor, as necessary. Students are responsible for meeting posted deadlines for registering with
Accessible  Learning  and  booking  accommodated  exams.  Accessible  Learning  cannot  guarantee
accommodations for requests received after posted deadlines.

Plagiarism: Wilfrid Laurier University uses software that can check for plagiarism. If requested to do so by
course  instructors,  students  are  required  to  submit  their  written  work  in  electronic  form  and  have  it
checked for plagiarism.

Academic Integrity: Laurier is committed to a culture of integrity within and beyond the classroom. This
culture  values  honesty,  integrity,  reliability,  fairness,  caring,  respect,  accountability,  responsibility  and
citizenship.  Together,  we  have  a  shared  responsibility  to  uphold  this  culture  in  our  academic  and
nonacademic behaviour. It is expected that all students will follow assignment instructions and will adhere
to Laurier’s regulations with respect to Academic Integrity. As a Laurier student, you are responsible for
familiarizing yourself with this policy and the accompanying penalty guidelines, some of which may appear
on your transcript if there is a finding of misconduct.

Ignorance of Laurier’s academic misconduct policy is not a defense

8

The relevant policy can be found at Laurier's Academic Integrity website along with resources to educate
and support you in upholding a culture of integrity.

The following, but not limited to, are violations of Laurier’s Academic Code of Conduct:

1.  Accessing unauthorized resources (Google, chat rooms, Chegg, Reddit, ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek,

etc.) for assessments.

2.  Using technological aids beyond what is listed as permitted in an assessment.
3.  Posting  test,  assignment,  lab  or  exam  questions  to  message  boards,  social  media,  or  other
unauthorized websites (ex. Chegg or CourseHero). While these third parties claim to be tutoring
resources, for a fee they take your work and share it with other students; an act that constitutes
an action of academic misconduct.

4.  Copying the work of others by way of file or image sharing.
5.  Posting  test,  assignment,  lab  or  exam  questions  and  answers  in  virtual  "course  groups"  (ex.

Facebook, Discord or WhatsApp).

6.  Copying the work that is shared or posted in virtual "course groups" (ex. Facebook, Discord or

WhatsApp).

7.  Working  collaboratively  with  others  on  assessments  that  are  expected  to  be  completed

individually.

8.  Copying  the  work  of  others  by  writing  down  answers  that  they  tell  you,  but  that  you  did  not

independently determine.

9.  Backdating emails to gain more time to complete assessments.
