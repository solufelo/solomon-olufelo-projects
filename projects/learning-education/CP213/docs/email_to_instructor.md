Subject: Academic Advising Request - CP213 Course Selection Guidance - Student ID: 210729170

Dear Esther,

Hope you're doing well! Following up on our conversation after class on Tuesday about my CP213 situation. I know you advised against the virtual asynchronous format, and I completely understand your concerns given my academic history.

However, I've been thinking a lot about what you said, and I'm wondering if you might reconsider letting me try this - just this once. I know this might sound like I'm not listening to your advice, but hear me out.

Here's why this matters so much to me:

I spent my entire summer coding - it was basically my way of preparing for this comeback. I actually completed a full Udemy object-oriented programming course with certification just 2 months ago. So CP213 would be perfect timing to solidify what I learned and make sure it doesn't just fade away.

I know virtual courses haven't worked well for me before, but this feels different. I've already set up everything - Eclipse, got the textbook, studied the syllabus. More importantly, I'm genuinely excited about this material in a way I haven't felt about coursework in a long time.

I understand your concerns about the virtual format, and I respect that you know what's usually best for students in my situation. But I'm asking if you'd give me a chance to prove that this time can be different. 

Here's what I'm committing to if you'll support me staying in this course:
- Attending the instructor's virtual office hours every week without fail
- Participating actively in all course discussions 
- Checking in with you regularly about how it's going
- Using campus resources proactively if I start to struggle
- Being completely honest with you if the virtual format isn't working

I know I'm asking you to go against your professional judgment here, and I don't take that lightly. But this course connects directly to the work I put in all summer, and I'm worried that if I don't take it now, I'll lose momentum on the one thing that's actually motivating me academically.

Would you be willing to let me try this, with the understanding that if it's not working out, I'll listen to your guidance on next steps? Today is the deadline, so I need to make this decision, but I really value your input and support.

This feels like an important decision for getting back on track academically, and I want to make sure I'm thinking about it the right way.

Thanks for all your support so far - the SASP program has already been really helpful in getting me to think more strategically about these kinds of decisions.
