# Slice 1: Java Development Basics

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
**Compile, run, debug, and document Java programs**

## 📚 What You'll Master

### Core Skills
- ✅ Set up and use Java development environment
- ✅ Write basic Java programs with proper structure
- ✅ Compile Java code using `javac`
- ✅ Run Java programs using `java`
- ✅ Debug programs using print statements and IDE tools
- ✅ Document code with comments and JavaDoc
- ✅ Follow Java naming conventions and style guidelines

### Why This Matters
This is your foundation. **Every single program** you write in this course (and career) starts here. You can't learn OOP, arrays, or threading if you can't compile and run code.

## ⏱️ Time Investment
- **Concepts**: 15 minutes
- **Examples**: 30 minutes
- **Practice**: 45 minutes
- **Project**: 60 minutes
- **Self-Assessment**: 30 minutes
- **Total**: ~3 hours

## 📖 Chapter Mapping
- Chapter 1: Getting Started (pages 1-56)
- Chapter 2: Program Style (pages 85-95)

## 🎮 Quest Structure

### Level 1: Learn (30 min)
1. Read `01-concepts.md` (15 min)
2. Run all examples in `02-examples/` (15 min)
3. Review flashcards (10 min)

**Success Criteria**: Can explain what compilation is and write a basic program

### Level 2: Practice (45 min)
1. Solve 5 practice problems in `03-practice/`
2. Compare with solutions
3. Fix any mistakes

**Success Criteria**: Can write, compile, and run programs independently

### Level 3: Build (60-90 min)
1. Complete the mini-project in `04-project/`
2. Test your program thoroughly
3. Document your code

**Success Criteria**: Working program that compiles, runs, and is well-documented

### Boss Battle: Self-Assessment (30 min)
1. Complete `06-self-assessment.md` without notes
2. Score 16/20 or higher (80%)
3. Review weak areas

**Success Criteria**: 80%+ score = SLICE COMPLETE ✅

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `01-concepts.md` and read it completely
2. Work through examples in order
3. Don't skip the practice problems!
4. Build the project from scratch (no copy-paste)
5. Take the self-assessment honestly

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Compile errors are your friends** - They teach you syntax
- **Run your code frequently** - Test after every small change
- **Comment as you code** - Don't wait until the end
- **Type code, don't copy-paste** - Muscle memory matters

## 🆘 When You're Stuck

1. Read the error message carefully (it tells you what's wrong)
2. Check the examples for similar code
3. Review the concepts section
4. Look at practice problem solutions for patterns
5. Use the Java documentation (google "Java API")

## ✅ Completion Checklist

- [ ] Read all concepts
- [ ] Ran all examples successfully
- [ ] Completed 5/5 practice problems
- [ ] Built mini-project from scratch
- [ ] Reviewed flashcards
- [ ] Scored 80%+ on self-assessment
