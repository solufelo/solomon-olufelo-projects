# Slices Directory - Vertical Learning Units

This directory contains 10 complete learning slices, each mapped to the CP213 course learning outcomes.

---

## 📂 Structure

Each slice folder contains the same 7 components:

```
XX-slice-name/
├── 00-ROADMAP.md          ← Start here: overview, time estimate, learning outcomes
├── 01-concepts.md         ← Theory and concepts (10-20 min read)
├── 02-examples/           ← Working code examples (copy, run, modify)
├── 03-practice/           ← Practice problems + solutions
├── 04-project/            ← Mini-project to integrate concepts
├── 05-flashcards.md       ← Active recall questions (with Quizlet import)
└── 06-self-assessment.md  ← Test yourself (must score 80%+ to pass)
```

## 🎯 The 10 Slices

### **Foundation Slices** (Start here)
1. **Java Dev Basics** - Compile, run, debug, document programs
2. **Input/Output** - User input, file I/O, formatting

### **Core OOP Slices** (Most important!)
3. **OOP Fundamentals** - Classes, objects, encapsulation ⭐ 30% of exam
4. **OOP Advanced** - Interfaces, inner classes, generics
5. **Arrays** - Array manipulation and algorithms
6. **Inheritance & Polymorphism** - Extends, override, abstract classes ⭐ 25% of exam

### **Advanced Slices**
7. **Exception Handling** - Try-catch, custom exceptions
8. **GUI (Swing)** - Graphical user interfaces
9. **Modern Java** - Lambda, varargs, autoboxing
10. **Threading** - Multi-threading, synchronization, race conditions

## 🚀 How to Use

### **For Each Slice:**

1. **Open the ROADMAP** (`00-ROADMAP.md`)
   - See what you'll learn
   - Check time estimate
   - Understand success criteria

2. **Read the Concepts** (`01-concepts.md`)
   - Take notes
   - Don't rush
   - Understand before moving on

3. **Run the Examples** (`02-examples/`)
   - Compile each file
   - Run it
   - Modify and experiment
   - Type the code yourself (don't copy-paste!)

4. **Solve Practice Problems** (`03-practice/`)
   - Try them WITHOUT looking at solutions
   - Check solutions only after attempting
   - If stuck, review concepts and examples

5. **Build the Mini-Project** (`04-project/`)
   - Read project spec
   - Plan before coding
   - Build incrementally
   - Test thoroughly

6. **Review Flashcards** (`05-flashcards.md`)
   - Cover the answers
   - Test yourself
   - Import to Quizlet/Anki if you want

7. **Take Self-Assessment** (`06-self-assessment.md`)
   - Set a timer
   - No notes allowed
   - Score yourself honestly
   - **Must get 80%+ to move to next slice**

## ✅ Completion Criteria

**A slice is complete when:**
- [ ] Read all concepts
- [ ] Ran all examples successfully
- [ ] Solved ALL practice problems
- [ ] Built mini-project from scratch
- [ ] Reviewed flashcards
- [ ] Scored 80%+ on self-assessment
- [ ] Can explain concepts without notes

**Don't skip ahead!** Each slice builds on the previous ones.

---

## 🎮 Current Status

**Slice 1**: ✅ Fully built with all components  
**Slices 2-10**: 📋 Roadmaps created (ready to be populated as you progress)

**Start with Slice 1** to see the complete structure, then move through sequentially.

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Track your progress in: `/home/solom/Projects/CP213/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`

Update after completing each component:
- Mark concepts as read
- Count practice problems solved
- Note mini-project completion
- Record self-assessment score

## 🔥 Priority Order (If Short on Time)

**Must Master** (85% of exam):
1. Slice 3: OOP Fundamentals (30%)
2. Slice 6: Inheritance & Polymorphism (25%)
3. Slice 5: Arrays (15%)
4. Slice 7: Exceptions (15%)

**Should Know**:
5. Slice 9: Modern Java (5%)
6. Slice 10: Threading (5%)

**Nice to Have**:
7. Slice 2: Input/Output (3%)
8. Slice 8: GUI (2%)

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **One slice at a time** - Don't jump around
2. **Type the code** - Don't copy-paste
3. **Take breaks** - 25 min work, 5 min break
4. **Review previous slices** - Every 3 slices, review older ones
5. **Ask for help** - If stuck for 30+ minutes
6. **Celebrate wins** - Completed a slice? Celebrate! 🎉

## 🆘 If You're Stuck

1. Re-read the concepts section
2. Run the examples again
3. Google: "Java [concept] explained"
4. Watch a YouTube tutorial
5. Ask in office hours or study group
6. Take a break and come back fresh
