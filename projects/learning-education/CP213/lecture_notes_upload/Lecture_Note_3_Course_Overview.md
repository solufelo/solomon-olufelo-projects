## 3. Study Strategies

### Active Learning
*   **Code Along:** Don't just read; type out examples.
*   **Break It:** Intentionally introduce bugs to understand error messages.
*   **Teach It:** Explain concepts to a peer (or rubber duck).

### Exam Prep Checklist
*   [ ] Review Flashcards (daily spaced repetition).
*   [ ] Complete all practice problems in `slices/` directory.
*   [ ] Practice coding by hand (for written exams).
*   [ ] Review common "gotchas" (e.g., `==` vs `.equals()`, pass-by-value).

## 4. Key Resources
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
*   **Documentation:** Official Oracle Java Docs.
*   **Version Control:** Git/GitHub.
