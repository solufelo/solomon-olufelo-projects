# CP213 Master Learning Path - Vertical Slice Approach
## From Zero to Exam Ready - Complete Course Mastery

> **Purpose**: This is your roadmap from "I don't know Java" to "I can ace this exam". Each slice is a complete vertical unit: concept → code → practice → project → test yourself.

## 📋 How Each Slice Works (Vertical Slice Structure)

Every slice folder contains these 7 components:

```
slices/XX-slice-name/
├── 00-ROADMAP.md              # What you'll learn, why it matters, time estimate
├── 01-concepts.md             # Core theory (10-15 min read)
├── 02-examples/               # Working code examples with comments
│   ├── Example01_Basic.java
│   ├── Example02_Intermediate.java
│   └── Example03_Advanced.java
├── 03-practice/               # 5-10 practice problems
│   ├── problems.md
│   └── solutions/
├── 04-project/                # Mini-project integrating all concepts
│   ├── project-spec.md
│   ├── starter-code/
│   └── solution/
├── 05-flashcards.md           # Active recall questions
└── 06-self-assessment.md      # Check your understanding (20 questions)
```

## 🎮 Study Method (Gamification Style)

### **Daily Quest System**

**Level 1 Quest** (30 min): 
1. Read `01-concepts.md`
2. Run all examples in `02-examples/`
3. Complete Flashcards

**Level 2 Quest** (45 min):
1. Attempt 3 practice problems
2. Compare with solutions
3. Fix mistakes

**Level 3 Quest** (60-90 min):
1. Start mini-project
2. Build incrementally
3. Test edge cases

**Boss Battle** (30 min):
- Complete self-assessment
- Score 80%+ to "defeat boss"
- Move to next slice

### **Achievement Tracking**
```
🏆 Slice Completed: 0/10
⭐ Practice Problems: 0/70
🎯 Projects Built: 0/10
🔥 Current Streak: 0 days
