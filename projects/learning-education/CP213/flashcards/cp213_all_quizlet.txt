General-purpose language	Java suitable for most any application type
James Gosling	Led team at Sun Microsystems that developed Java

Java byte-code	Intermediate language Java programs compile to
Byte-code	Java's intermediate language for all platforms
Machine language	Final language specific to each processor
Cost savings	Benefit of two-step translation process
Translation programs	Compilers that convert code to machine language
Program translation	Converting source code to executable form
Code compilation	Process of translating source code to byte-code
Byte-code execution	Running byte-code on Java Virtual Machine
Java Virtual Machine	JVM - runs byte-code on different platforms
Platform independence	Java's ability to run on different operating systems
Write once, run anywhere	Java's platform independence principle
Object-oriented programming	OOP - programming methodology using objects
Class	Group of objects with same type and methods
Method	Action that objects can perform

# Chapter 2 — Console I/O (selected)
System.out.println	Method to output data to display screen with newline
System.out.print	Method to output data to display screen without newline
Concatenation operator	+ operator combines strings and values
Escape sequence \n	Newline character
Scanner class	Java class for keyboard and file input (Java 5.0+)
keyboard = new Scanner(System.in)	Create Scanner for console input
FileInputStream	Handles connection between program and file
FileNotFoundException	Thrown when file doesn't exist
hasNextLine()	Checks if more data available in file
nextInt()/nextLine() issue	nextInt() leaves newline; add extra nextLine() to clear buffer

# Chapter 3 — Flow of Control (selected)
if-else statement	Chooses between alternatives based on Boolean expression
equals() for Strings	Use equals()/equalsIgnoreCase() not ==
while loop	Checks condition before each iteration
do-while loop	Executes body at least once
for loop	Initialization; condition; update
Off-by-one error	Loop executes one too many or few times
Random in [a,b]	rand.nextInt(b - a + 1) + a

# Chapter 4 — Defining Classes I (selected)
Encapsulation	Keep fields private; expose getters/setters with validation
Constructor	Initializes instance variables; may chain with this(...)
Method overloading	Same name, different parameter lists (number/types/order)
Static members	Belong to class, not instances

# Chapter 5 — Defining Classes II (selected)
Reference semantics	Assignments copy references; objects can be aliased
Privacy leak	Returning internal mutable references; fix with defensive copies
Packages/imports	Organize classes; bring types into scope

# Chapter 6 — Arrays
Array	Collection of variables with uniform naming mechanism
Zero-based indexing	Array indices start at 0
array.length	Number of indexed variables in array
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException	Error when accessing invalid index
Partially filled array	Track numberUsed separate from capacity
Use count in loops	for (int i = 0; i < numberUsed; i++)

# Chapter 6.2 — Arrays & References (Q/A normalized)
What does the declaration `double[] a;` create?	A variable of an array type that can hold a reference to an array object
What does `new double[10]` do?	Creates an array object in memory
What does `a = new double[10];` do?	Stores the reference to the array object in variable a
What is the only instance variable arrays have?	length
How do arrays behave for assignment/equality/parameters?	As reference types; assignment copies references; equality compares references; passing shares the object

# Chapter 6.4 — Multidimensional Arrays (Q/A normalized)
What is a multidimensional array?	An array with more than one index (e.g., rows and columns)
Syntax for 2D array?	Base_Type[][] name = new Base_Type[rows][columns];
Access element in 2D array?	array[row][col]
2D in Java actually is?	Array of arrays (ragged allowed)
Invalid index result?	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

# Chapter 4 — Encapsulation / API / Packages
Information hiding	Separate public use from private implementation
Encapsulation	Bundle data + methods; expose minimal public API
API	Public methods documenting how to use the class
Private fields	Disallow direct external access to state
Get/Set methods	Public accessors/mutators with validation
Package	Groups related classes; controls visibility
import statement	Brings classes from a package into scope

# Chapter 4 — Constructors
Constructor	Special method to initialize new objects
Default constructor	No-arg constructor auto-provided if none defined
Constructor overloading	Multiple constructors with different parameters
this(...) chaining	One constructor calls another in same class
Constructor vs method	Constructor has no return type; same name as class

# Chapter 4 — Method Overloading
Overloading	Same method name, different parameter lists
Signature	Method name + parameter types (return type not part)
Invalid overloading	Changing only return type (same parameters)
Compiler selection	Chooses most specific match by parameter types

# Chapter 4 — Static
Static method	Callable via ClassName.method(); no instance required
Static field	One copy shared by all instances
Static limits	Cannot access instance fields or use this
Math.max/abs/sqrt	Common static utility examples

# Chapter 5 — References & Parameters
Reference variable	Stores an address to an object (not the object)
Assignment copies reference	Two variables can alias same object
equals() vs ==	Use equals() for content; == compares references
Array parameter behavior	Methods can modify original array elements
Pass-by-value	Java passes copies (including copies of references)
