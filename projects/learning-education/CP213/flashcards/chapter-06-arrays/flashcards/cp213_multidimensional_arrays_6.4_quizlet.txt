A: 0 through 11 (12 elements).

Q: What happens if you access an invalid index in a multidimensional array?
A: You get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Q: In Java, what is a two-dimensional array actually?
A: A two-dimensional array is actually an array of arrays.

Q: What does `char[][] a = new char[5][12];` actually create?
A: A one-dimensional array of size 5, where each element is a reference to a one-dimensional array of 12 characters.

Q: What is the base type of the array `a` in `char[][] a = new char[5][12];`?
A: The base type is `char[]` (array of characters).

Q: What does each element `a[0]`, `a[1]`, etc. contain in a 2D array?
A: Each element contains a reference to a one-dimensional array.

Q: How is a three-dimensional array structured?
A: A three-dimensional array is an array of arrays of arrays.

Q: What is the advantage of thinking about 2D arrays as arrays with two indices?
A: It's simpler and easier to understand than thinking of them as arrays of arrays.

Q: When might you need to understand that a 2D array is an array of arrays?
A: When working with jagged arrays or when you need to access individual row arrays directly.

Q: How do you get the length of the first dimension of a 2D array?
A: Use `arrayName.length` to get the number of rows.

Q: How do you get the length of the second dimension of a 2D array?
A: Use `arrayName[0].length` to get the number of columns (assuming all rows have the same length).

Q: What is the syntax for declaring a 2D array of doubles with 100 rows and 10 columns?
A: `double[][] table = new double[100][10];`

Q: Can you create a 2D array of objects (like Person class)?
A: Yes, for example: `Person[][] entry = new Person[10][10];`

Q: What is the difference between `int[][]` and `int[]`?
A: `int[][]` is a 2D array (array of arrays), while `int[]` is a 1D array.

Q: How do you initialize a specific element in a 2D array?
A: Use `arrayName[row][col] = value;` syntax.

Q: How do you loop through all elements in a 2D array?
A: Use nested loops: `for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) for (int j = 0; j < array[i].length; j++)`

Q: What is the time complexity of accessing an element in a 2D array?
A: O(1) constant time for direct access using indices.

Q: What is the space complexity of a 2D array?
A: O(rows × columns) for the data, plus overhead for the array structure.

Q: How do you copy a 2D array?
A: Create a new array and copy each element, or use `System.arraycopy()` for each row.

Q: What is a jagged array?
A: A 2D array where each row can have a different number of columns.

Q: How do you create a jagged array?
A: First create the array of arrays, then create each row array separately with different lengths.

Q: What is the advantage of understanding 2D arrays as arrays of arrays?
A: It helps understand memory layout and allows for more flexible array structures like jagged arrays.

Q: Can you have arrays with different base types in different dimensions?
A: No, all elements must be of the same base type, but the dimensions can have different sizes.

Q: How do you pass a 2D array to a method?
A: Use the same syntax as 1D arrays: `methodName(int[][] array)` and pass the array name.

Q: What happens when you pass a 2D array to a method?
A: A reference to the array is passed, so modifications affect the original array.

Q: How do you return a 2D array from a method?
A: Use `return arrayName;` where the return type is declared as `Base_Type[][]`.

Q: What is the difference between `new int[5][12]` and `new int[12][5]`?
A: The first creates 5 rows with 12 columns each, the second creates 12 rows with 5 columns each.

Q: How do you find the total number of elements in a 2D array?
A: Multiply the number of rows by the number of columns: `array.length * array[0].length`.

Q: What is a common use case for 2D arrays?
A: Representing matrices, game boards, images (pixel data), tables, or any grid-based data.

Q: How do you check if two 2D arrays are equal?
A: Compare dimensions first, then compare each element using nested loops.

Q: What is the advantage of using 2D arrays over nested 1D arrays?
A: 2D arrays provide a more intuitive syntax and are optimized by the JVM for better performance.

Q: How do you initialize a 2D array with specific values?
A: Use array initialization syntax: `int[][] matrix = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}, {7,8,9}};`

Q: What is the memory layout of a 2D array in Java?
A: An array of references to row arrays, where each row array contains the actual data elements.

Q: How do you traverse a 2D array row by row?
A: Use `for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) for (int j = 0; j < array[i].length; j++)`

Q: How do you traverse a 2D array column by column?
A: Use `for (int j = 0; j < array[0].length; j++) for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)`

Q: What is the relationship between array dimensions and nested loops?
A: You need one loop for each dimension of the array to traverse all elements systematically.
