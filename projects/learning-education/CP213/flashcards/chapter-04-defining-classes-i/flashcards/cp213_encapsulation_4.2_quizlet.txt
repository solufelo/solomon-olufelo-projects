Information hiding	Separating how to use a class from implementation details
Abstraction	Another term for information hiding; discarding unnecessary details
Encapsulation	Grouping software into units with well-defined simple interfaces
API	Application Programming Interface - description of how to use a class
ADT	Abstract Data Type - data type using good information hiding techniques
Public modifier	No restrictions on where instance variable can be used
Private modifier	Instance variable cannot be accessed by name outside class definition
Public method	Method with no restrictions on its usage
Private method	Method can only be used within the same class definition
Good programming practice	Make all instance variables private
Instance variable access	Private variables accessible through class methods only
Method visibility	Methods can be public (external use) or private (internal use only)
Helping method	Private method used solely in definition of other methods
DateSecondTry example	Class with private instance variables (month, day, year)

Data protection	Private modifier protects data from unauthorized access
Interface design	Public methods define how external code interacts with class
Implementation hiding	Private members hide internal workings from external code
Class user perspective	Programmer using class only needs to know public interface
Class designer perspective	Can change private implementation without affecting users
ReadInput method	Public method to change private instance variable values

DateFifthTry example	Improved class with private variables and validation
DateOK method	Private helping method to validate date values

Boolean return type	Methods that return true or false values
Date validation	Checking for impossible dates like January 63
Fatal error handling	Program termination when invalid data is encountered
System.exit(0)	Method to terminate program execution
This keyword	Refers to current object in method definitions
Instance variable assignment	this.month = monthString(month)
Conditional validation	if (dateOK(month, day, year)) { /* valid date */ }
Error message output	System.out.println("Fatal Error")
Data integrity	Ensuring data remains valid and consistent
Access control	Controlling how class members can be accessed
Encapsulation benefits	Simplifies class usage and protects data
