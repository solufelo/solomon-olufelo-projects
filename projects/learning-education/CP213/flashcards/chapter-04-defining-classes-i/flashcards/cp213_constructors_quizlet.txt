Constructor	Special method designed to perform initialization when creating objects
Constructor purpose	Initialize instance variables and perform setup actions
Constructor invocation	new DateSixthTry() calls the constructor
Constructor name	Must have same name as the class
Default constructor	Automatically provided constructor with no arguments
Automatic constructor	Java creates default constructor if none defined
Default constructor behavior	Creates object but does little else
Custom constructor	User-defined constructor for specific initialization
Constructor overloading	Multiple constructors with different parameter lists
Constructor signature	Constructor name plus parameter list
Constructor body	Code that executes when constructor is called
Instance variable initialization	Setting initial values for object data
Object initialization	Process of setting up new object state
Constructor parameters	Values passed to constructor for initialization
Constructor arguments	Actual values passed when calling constructor
this keyword in constructor	Refers to the object being constructed
Constructor chaining	One constructor calling another constructor
Super constructor	Calling parent class constructor
Constructor visibility	Public, private, or protected access modifiers
Private constructor	Constructor that cannot be called from outside class
Public constructor	Constructor accessible from anywhere
Protected constructor	Constructor accessible within package and subclasses
Constructor inheritance	Constructors are not inherited from parent classes
Constructor overriding	Constructors cannot be overridden
Constructor polymorphism	Different constructors for different initialization needs
Parameterized constructor	Constructor that takes parameters for initialization
No-argument constructor	Constructor with no parameters
Copy constructor	Constructor that creates object from another object
Static constructor	No such thing - constructors are always instance methods
Constructor return type	Constructors have no return type (not even void)
Constructor vs method	Constructor: same name as class, no return type
Method: different name, has return type
