## 🎯 Key Features

### **1. Vertical Slice Approach**
Each slice is a COMPLETE learning unit:
```
Theory → Examples → Practice → Project → Assessment → MASTERY
```

### **2. Mapped to Course Learning Outcomes**
Every slice directly addresses a specific course learning outcome:
- Compile/run/debug programs ✅
- User input/output ✅
- OOP with classes/objects ✅
- Advanced OOP features ✅
- Arrays ✅
- Inheritance/Polymorphism/Abstract classes ✅
- Exception handling ✅
- GUI development ✅
- Modern Java features ✅
- Threading and concurrency ✅

### **3. Gamification System**
- Quest-based structure (Level 1, 2, 3, Boss Battle)
- Achievement tracking
- Streak counting
- Progress bars
- "Beat the level" mentality

### **4. Priority-Based Learning**
Shows you EXACTLY what matters:
- OOP Fundamentals: 30% of exam
- Inheritance/Polymorphism: 25% of exam
- Arrays: 15% of exam
- Exception Handling: 15% of exam
= **85% of exam in 4 topics!**

### **5. Comprehensive Assessment**
- Practice problems for hands-on learning
- Mini-projects for integration
- Flashcards for active recall
- Self-assessments to verify mastery (must score 80%+)
