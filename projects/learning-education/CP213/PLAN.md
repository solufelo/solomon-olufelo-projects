## Study Artifact Plan (Midterm)

### Goals
- Ensure first-time comprehension for CP213 midterm topics (Ch. 1–6).
- Minimize redundancy by consolidating from `study-guide.md`, `exam-prep.md`, and `resources/`.

### Artifacts
- `midterm_quizlet.md`: Active recall Q&A + drills.
- `midterm_deep_study.md`: Layered drills, code katas, exam simulations.

### Usage
- Daily 10–15 min spaced prompts (see the "First-Time Comprehension Drills" section).
- Weekly: run through Quick Self-Check and fill any gaps using chapter flashcards.

### Next Steps
- Expand with example-driven mini-problems for arrays and constructors.
- Convert to Anki/Quizlet import if needed (`resources/flashcards`).
- Run one full Exam Simulation (Layer 4) 7–10 days before the midterm.
